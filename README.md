I'm [Hyunwoo Kim](https://mastertyper.com), highly self-motivated freelance software engineer with experience in startups and middle-standing company.

Currently, I am working on an algorithmic trading project called **[MIDAS X]<!--(https://github.com/MIDASX-Inc)-->**.

I developed an algorithmic trading program using chart analysis. An algorithm containing the **investment know-how of a fund manager with more than 10 years of experience** has been applied. The program is called **Midas Trader**. The goal of my current project is to make a **10% profit of the investment** through day trading. The success rate should be **greater than 90%**.

MIDAS X was influenced by:
> - **[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)**, Judge Business School Executive Education
> - **[Bob Jones University](https://www.bju.edu/)**, Department of Computer Science
> - Etc...
